# Ingredients
- 2 cups cooked rice (preferably day-old)
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1/2 cup diced carrots
- 1/2 cup peas
- 1/2 cup diced onions
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 cup diced cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu (optional)
- 2 green onions, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the ingredients**: Ensure all vegetables and proteins are diced and ready to go.
2. **Scramble the eggs**: Heat 1 tbsp of vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over medium heat. Pour in the beaten eggs and scramble until fully cooked. Remove from the pan and set aside.
3. **Sauté vegetables**: Add the remaining oil to the pan. Sauté onions, carrots, peas, and garlic until softened, about 3-5 minutes.
4. **Add rice**: Increase heat to high and add the cooked rice. Stir-fry for a few minutes, breaking up any clumps.
5. **Season**: Pour in the soy sauce, sesame oil, and black pepper. Stir well to combine.
6. **Add protein and eggs**: If using, add cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu. Then, return the scrambled eggs to the pan and mix well.
7. **Final touch**: Stir-fry everything for another 2 minutes until well combined and heated through.
8. **Garnish and serve**: Top with chopped green onions and serve hot.

## Tips
- Use cold, day-old rice for better texture.
- Customize with your favorite vegetables and proteins.
- Adjust soy sauce to taste, or use low-sodium soy sauce if preferred.
